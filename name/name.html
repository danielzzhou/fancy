  <p> I go by Daniel. </p>
<p>But let’s start with my Chinese name.</p>
<p>On a rainy September afternoon 20 years ago, my parents were sitting on a humble couch in a cramped apartment in Shanghai. Waiting for their baby’s arrival in two weeks, they had spent days and nights deliberating his name and finally agreed on “Zhou Zhi Heng.” </p>
<p>“Zhou” (/Joh/) is my last name. Zhi (/Jə/) means “reach” or “achieve,” and Heng(/Hung/) means “persistence.” My parents, then in their late 20s, wanted me to be a determined person when I grow up. </p>
<p>But my name has encountered some trouble in the United States, where I have spent my life for more than two years. </p>
<p>It was the last class of a multimedia journalism course in a fancy lecture hall during the last month of my freshman year. The professor, for the first time, read out students’ “official” names to collect the equipment kits. She called on most students by their first names but when it came to me on the roster, she directly jumped to my last name “Zhou” but … still garbled it. Though I knew my name should come the last on the roster by alphabetical order, I still missed it when “zoo” came out of her mouth.  </p>
<p>“Zhou” simply sounds like "joe” but people in the U.S. usually pronounce as "zau" or "zoo.” And my first name “Zhiheng” sounds so intimidating that it immediately slips away from their mind right after my introduction. It was never right, even for some Chinese Americans whom I assumed would excel at this. </p>
<p>Afraid that my name would be mispronounced –or worse, forgotten – I erased “Zhiheng” in my school email address, in “Canvas” - the student academic website - and other non-official school systems before I even started college in the U.S. And “Daniel,” my first and only English nickname I adopted in kindergarten, has replaced “Zhiheng” as my everyday name.</p>
<p>Like many of my other Chinese international peers in the U.S., I concealed my original first name. As I am so used to being called by our English names in our daily lives, I was somehow surprised to hear that other international students are insisting that Americans use their Chinese names.</p>
<p>In early 2017, some Chinese students in Columbia University found their name tags ripped off in their dorm rooms. In response to the racism vandalism, a group of Chinese students launched a “Say My Name” video campaign online that later went viral. Though multicultural organizations in other universities had cultural campaigns to promote international identities, “Say My Name,” with more than 449K views and 5.3K shares on Facebook, is one of the first times that the Chinese international student community actively stood out for their own identities through reclaiming the names. </p>
<p> The video producer of the campaign, Yan Huhe (/Yen Hoo Heh/), sophomore at Columbia University, hoped to resolve the vandalism problem in a more “educational and informative” way. “In the effort to blend into English-speaking society and to be easily called upon during conversations—a considerate act in our eyes—we have conceded a part of our identity which has only silenced us more,” Yan said.</p>
<p>In reaction to the campaign, Chinese students who rarely questioned what Americans should call them – let alone their identities in China – are making more self-conscious decisions on their names and questioning their own identities in the United States. </p>

   <p>I started wondering if I should use “Zhiheng” instead. My dad had explained how important the philosophical meaning behind my name is. </p>
<p>“Zhou,” my last name, can also mean a circle; “Zhi” means “to,” “Heng” refers to an extending straight line. According to my dad, a circulating circle and a straight line will create an upward spiral in my life. “I didn’t tell you when you were a kid,” he said, “but now you are ready to face it.” </p>
<p>When I heard that, I felt ashamed to not use my Chinese name. But even when I tried, I couldn’t introduce myself as Zhi Heng. But I always failed in trying to say it during introduction. When my teeth were ready to touch on each other, I paused, looked into the unfamiliar person’s eyes and gave up.</p>
<p>“Hi, I am Zh … Daniel.” </p>
<p>Then I saw an article in Chinese called “Why do We Hide Our Chinese Names?” that garnered more than 410K hits and 2K likes on a WeChat forum called “Panopath.” The author, Li Shengyue (/Lee Shung Yu-eh/), a junior student in Claremont Mckenna College, said she, too, had experienced similar struggles with her names. [what struggles – she, too, couldn’t decide what name to use.</p>

      <h3>“Landing in the U.S. for college is like unlocking another map in video games, you are entering a new world and you pick new character,” Li said, “maybe necessarily… with a new name.”</h3>
   <p>Li had chosen “Lisy” (/Lee-sy/) as her preferred name in the U.S. She seldom mentioned her Chinese name when she first arrived in California, secretly hoping that others would not find out her identity as an outsider to the new culture. </p>
<p>As “Lisy,” she has transformed from a speaker to a listener: the expressive leader in China who initiated a couple of campaigns suddenly became a quiet girl in the U.S. However, Li doesn’t view the “character change” negatively.  </p>
<p>Parents’ high expectations put on Chinese names might sometimes be a heavy burden. When students start their lives in a new cultural environment, they prefer using a “cool” English name that they picked for themselves. Some got the inspiration from their own anecdotes, interesting myths or simply their favor for specific alphabets, Li explained.</p>  
<p>In fact, our original Chinese names can never be completely kept here. When the characters are transformed into Latin alphabets, the art of strokes, structures and tones in Chinese names are, inevitably, lost. Two characters in the first names are merged into one overwhelming word; first names always come before last names. Many have to live with an alternative version of their names, merely an awkward approximation of the original sounds.</p>
<p>Lu Fenghua (/Lu Fung Hwa/), a freshman at the University of Chicago, views the loss of the original meanings and sounds in her name “Fenghua” more optimistically.  
“People call me Lu Fenghua in China but now it has become ‘Fenghua’, sometimes ‘Fan-Gwa,’ without my last name,” Lu said. </p>
<p>This minor change made Lu’s name unfamiliar but she sees her new name as a mix of her old and new identities. “Fenghua” is an extension of her past life but being addressed in a more American way always reminds her of the new environments and challenges that she needs to face. </p>
<p>Like Lu, every international student has their own identity challenges to face here on the “new land.” </p>

<p>To make a more inclusive community, some campus diversity activists have tried to teach faculty and staff not only learn how to pronounce international students’ names but to also appreciate the cultural contexts behind their names.</p>
<p>Though many international students are used to their names being butchered, the efforts and understanding of domestic students and staff will really make a difference, according to Laura Hahn, former director of Intensive English Learning Center in the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. </p>
<p>With her expertise in phonetics, Hahn put up an instructional guide called  “Pronouncing International Students’ names” four years ago, in which she emphasized on the articulations of Chinese names. She later organized multiple staff workshops about names.</p>
<p>As an English as second language instructor and department director who interacts with abundant international students on a daily basis, Hahn researched the impact of pronunciation in listeners and intelligibility.  “English speakers have no idea what other language systems would sound like,” Hahn said, explaining that Chinese spelling (pinyin), though romanized in alphabets, does not accord with the typical English pronunciations. </p>
<p>Hahn got the inspiration of “Pronouncing International Students’ Name” from her own experiences. Students wince when their names are mispronounced and instructors, on the other side, also feel bad if they see the students’ unconscious facial expressions such as frowns, she said.</p>
<p>More than 5.6K Chinese international students are currently pursuing in a degree in UIUC, according to the report by Martin McFarlane, the director of international student and scholar service. Concerning this huge population, Hahn believes that one way to build an inclusive community is to actively learn how to pronounce students’ names and appreciate the meanings behind them, even with a typical big class size in the school.</p>

<h3>“Ask, then try. Show the effort,” Hahn said.</h3>
</br>

<p>On a warm spring afternoon last year, Li Shengyue attended a usual advising hour with her advisor Marc Massoud in his cramped office in the Bauer Center. Li was expressing her worries on academic choices and wondered if she should pursue an economic accounting major. Massoud pushed up his glasses a little bit and looked into Li’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Listen ‘Shan-gyew,’ you should …” He paused when he realized that he butchered Li’s name again. </p>
<p>“Sorry I know my name is hard to pronounce.” To defuse the awkward situation, Li replied. She is too used to such mispronunciations. </p>
<p>Massoud mused on Li’s words and smiled.</p> 
<h3>“Remember, I should be sorry,” he said.  “No one should be sorry about their own names, and their identities.” </h3>

<p> As absurd as it may sound like, we ourselves feel embarrassed when people have to stumble over our names. Not wanting to trouble others with our names, we seldom bring up the stories behind our names and the multicultural identities that we should be proud of.</p>
<p>As Chinese international students encounter the surge of U.S. culture, new identities pop up when we are redefining ourselves along the journey. And our names are just outlets for self representations.</p>  
<p>After I turned 18 and got ready for my college life, I realized one more story behind my name. Once when I was checking an ancient Chinese poem collection, I found that “Zhou Zhiheng” rhymes with the last characters of a poem that depicted a boat swinging on a wild lake by itself. The poem echoed my feelings as an international student who left home alone and travelled across the Pacific Ocean for college. I always saw myself as the lonely boat, wandering and looking for a new direction.</p>
<p>That is me. These stories are all part of me. </p>
<p>You can still call me Daniel but let’s try to pronounce -  “Zhou Zhiheng” (/Joh Jə Hung/). </p>
